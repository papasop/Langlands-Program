🧠 LANDS: Spectral Approach to the Langlands Program
From Zeta Paths to Hitchin Geometry and L-Function Simulation
A numerical framework to emulate automorphic structures and spectral Galois representations using modal path systems.

🔍 Overview
LANDS (Langlands Spectral System) is a numerical and geometric framework that uses spectral paths ψ(t) to simulate:

Automorphic L-functions 
𝐿

,
𝜓
)
L(s,ψ)

Zeta-like Λ(s) structures and critical line zeros

Trace-zero Higgs bundles φ(t) and Hitchin fibrations

It connects spectral modeling, differential geometry, and Langlands-type representations in a coherent path-based system.

 (t) matches Frobenius square trace trend with ~67% success.

SL(2,ℤ) invariance verified (T, S, TST transforms), supporting automorphic symmetry.

Optimized Laplacian residual MSE reduced from 114k to ~46 with 10-dimensional Hecke tuning.
